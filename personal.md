# Personal

* Physics has occupied a very large portion of my life. I'm extremely passionate about understanding the world around us from first principles and this has been something I've always wanted to do for all my life. Unfortunately, I had other concerns that sort of pushed me towards reality and consider a switch away from Physics although I absolutely love the work I do. I've written this up to make my thoughts documented in written words [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHNAtSWIIkav4CmcQVZcH2ZMKA8BsHL-qfGcUA8Tkh8/edit?usp=sharing). The tl;dr version of the write up is the following: being someone who is very specifically skilled and in a platform to be able to help those in need, I feel it is morally wrong on my part to be pursuing a career that would benefit primarily just myself. Instead, I would rather focus on making a career in making an impact to those who aren't in a platform to fend for themselves.

* My passion for physics shows when I teach. I've always strived to be spread my enthusiasm with people whom I speak to - this is one of the biggest lessons I took away from my time with Ananthan and Ravi (two of my biggest inspirations, both of whom, happened to be my physics teachers during high school). Unfortunately Ananthan is no more - I wrote [this](https://medium.com/@arunravishankar/to-the-man-who-made-me-fc51bc6514b0) tribute to him. 

* I am very passionate about animal welfare and bringing justice to beings in need. I wrote [this](https://medium.com/@arunravishankar/all-this-is-normal-should-it-be-50c399011dc5) a few years back, hoping to educate people about the horrendous ways animals are treated. Regarding other people in need, those who are differently abled, I wrote [this](https://medium.com/@arunravishankar/why-do-abnormal-people-get-treated-differently-ae0e10c226ca) to just put my thoughts into words.

* I enjoy being one with nature whenever I find the time. I've had some really good times in the Alps, the Himalayas, the Rockies and the Catalina mountains. I used to maintain a [blog](https://thepolarbearwalk.tumblr.com/) of all the outdoorsy adventures I had. I stopped later on because I didn't really find the time to. 

* My other major passion is Carnatic music. I learnt this southern Indian classical art form for many years in my childhood. Not a single day passes when I wouldn't have listened to at least 4-5 hours of this form of music. A large part of my worldview is influenced by this art form - creativity isn't just coming up with something completely new but is rather the act of navigating seamlessly through an elaborate framework/structure. Another way of saying this is that one becomes creative only when he/she has a deep, subconscious understanding of the framework. Why I say that this has influenced my world view is because I believe that there is importance in organization and structure.
